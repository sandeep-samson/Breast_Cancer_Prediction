# Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

**Project Introduction: Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

As part of the **"Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning"** guided project, I explored the practical implementation of machine learning for healthcare analysis. This 2-hour project focused on building a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign.  

Using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set** from Kaggle, I performed data cleaning and preparation to ensure optimal analysis. The entire project was carried out on the **Jupyter Notebook Environment**, leveraging its cloud-based tools for efficient computation and collaboration.  

This project was conducted purely for educational purposes, providing an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of logistic regression and hands-on data science skills. By the end, I had developed a functional classifier while gaining practical insights into working with cloud environments and handling real-world datasets.  

This experience has enhanced my proficiency in Python programming, data mining, and machine learning, equipping me with valuable tools for future endeavors in predictive analytics.
