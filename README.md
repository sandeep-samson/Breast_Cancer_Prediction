# Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

The **"Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning"** project focuses on developing a logistic regression classifier to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. Participants work with a real-world dataset, downloading it directly from Kaggle. The project emphasizes hands-on learning, utilizing Google Colab in the cloud for efficient model development and analysis. This practical experience equips learners with essential skills in Python programming, machine learning, data mining, and healthcare prediction.
